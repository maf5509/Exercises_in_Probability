The Monty Hall Problem is one in which you are a game show contestant, and you have to choose between three
doors. Behind one of the doors is a prize, whereas the other two have some booby prize (say, a goat) behind
them. Having chosen one of the doors, the host of the show opens one of the other doors to reveal a goat.
You now have two doors remaining: the one you have chosen and the other, as yet unconsidered door. 
The question is: should you switch your choice?
The most common answer is that it doesn't matter whether you switch choices, that your chances of winning
remain the same. In fact, the real answer is that you should switch. 

This can be understood if we consider that your initial choice was of course, for one of the three doors, which
means that there is a 1/3 chance that the prize is behind that door. That means that there is a 2/3 chance of
the prize being behind one of the other two doors. But the host then opens one of those doors revealing only
a goat, so that 2/3 chance now lies with only the remaining door. Thus your chances of success if you switch
to that third door will be 2/3, but if you stick with your original choice they remain at the original 1/3. 

This can be mathematically proven using Bayes' Rule.
